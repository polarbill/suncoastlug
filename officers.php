As with any group, someone has to handle the chores involved in keeping the
group running and alive. Those are the <EM>officers</EM> of the group.
Below is a list of the officers of this group and their duties. Some of these
positions are filled, and some people hold more than one office. These jobs
aren't glamorous, and you don't get paid for them. Your reward is the
satisfaction that you've done something (hopefully) effective to keep the
group alive and doing well. If you think you could help out, don't hesitate
to <a href="./volunteer.php">volunteer</a>!

President
</H3>
<P>
It's the President's job to ensure that the group runs smoothly, and that
the duties of the other officers get done effectively. This means that if
one of the other officers is absent, leaves or quits, his duties fall to the
President to do. He also acts as the spokesman and public representative of
the group. And the President acts as adjudicator of disputes among officers
and members. And since his job is to ensure that the other officers do their
jobs, he may step in to handle an officer's job where that officer has
failed to do it effectively.
<P>
<H3>
Vice-President
</H3>
<P>
The Vice-President acts in the President's stead where he is not available,
is incapacitated, or indisposed.
<P>
<H3>
Treasurer
</H3>
<P>
The Treasurer handles the money and physical assets of the group.
We do not have dues, but we do
accept donations.
It's the Treasurer's job to ensure we have money, that it's spent in
accordance with the wishes of the group, and that it is well-accounted for.
The Treasurer is a signatory on the group's bank account.
<P>
<H3>
Webmaster
</H3>
<P>
The Webmaster maintains and updates the website. His job is to ensure that
the content of the website is up to date, and that the next meeting is
announced on the website in advance of the event. He should maintain and not
cut corners on the content, and should ensure that the website is first and
foremost informative. Appearance is secondary, and in no case should the
website ever be Lynx-unfriendly.
<P>
<H3>
List Administrator
</H3>
<P>
This person's job is first, to ensure we have one or more lists for use by
the members. Secondly, he or she must maintain the subscription database and
subscribe and unsubscribe members as needed. Lastly, he or she must monitor
the lists to ensure that the charter for the lists are followed, and take
any action within the charter to ensure this.
<P>
<H3>
Event Coordinator
</H3>
<P>
This person ensures that meetings take place on a regular (at least monthly)
schedule and are promoted effectively to members. He or she shall also bring
the meetings and events to order and act as master of ceremonies. He may not
use meetings as his personal forum for voicing his own opinions and
prejudices. It is also his job to ensure that meetings are well attended,
and that there are good reasons for members to attend. This would generally
entail (among other things) lining up interesting speakers and presenters
for meetings.
