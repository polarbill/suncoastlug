The <B>Suncoast Linux Users Group (SLUG)</B>
holds monthly meetings at several locations and times. The monthly meetings
are a place where you can come to get help installing Linux or debugging
problems with your installation. You can occasionally hear speakers on
various subjects of interest to the Linux community. And you can enjoy
the company of others who are interested in the same thing you are-- Linux.
The cost? It's free!

What to bring</H3></CENTER>
If you're coming to install Linux on your computer, there are a few things
you should bring with you
<UL>
<LI>
Your computer. The whole thing. If you want to test your printer, bring
that too. If you have Apple hardware, you will have to bring your own copy
of Linux to install, and you may have to refer hardware questions to
your dealer, as we don't have a lot of Apple expertise.
</LI>
<LI>
Your copy of Linux, including any manuals that came with your distribution.
If you want to install someone else's copy of Linux, make sure they're
going to bring it to the meeting.
</LI>
<LI>
Any manuals for your computer, including manuals for any of the add-on
cards, etc., that you have.
</LI>
<LI>
Any DOS software you might need to configure network cards and the like.
</LI>
<LI>
Any floppies you might need to create boot disks with.
</LI>
<LI>
Pen and paper to record any sage advice you are given, as well as settings
for your computer.
</LI>
<LI>
Patience and a sense of humor!
</LI>
</UL>
<CENTER>
<H3>
What to do before you come</H3></CENTER>
Along with the items you should bring for installing Linux, there are some
details you should take care of before you come:
<UL>
<LI>
Back up everything of value on your computer. Things can sometimes go wrong,
and if you can't afford to lose what's on your hard drive, back it up first.
</LI>
<LI>
Write down every setting, IRQ, memory address, add-on card manufacturer,
make and model of everything about your computer. Trying to figure this
out at the meeting wastes valuable time.
</LI>
<LI>
Run scandisk/chkdsk and defragment your hard drive if you are coming from
a DOS/Windows environment.
</LI>
<LI>
Ensure you have enough memory and hard disk space to complete your Linux
installation. At a minimum, this means 4-8 megs of memory and 150 megs
of hard drive space.
</LI>
</UL>
<CENTER>
<H3>
Warning!</H3></CENTER>
While we will help you all we can, we cannot guarantee that the installation
will be compatible with your particular hardware, nor that we will be able
to successfully configure it to run. We are not responsible for any damage
or loss during or as a consequence of installing and configuring Linux,
X, or anything else.
